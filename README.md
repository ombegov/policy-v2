## About This Project

This site will provide a home for policy and other materials developed by the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer, which is part of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, within the Executive Office of the President. It is built to conform to the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov).

The intention is to consolidate a number of similar sites that currently exist on subdomains of cio.gov. Subdomains of cio.gov that _may_ be consolidated into this site over time include:

* playbook
* project-open-data
* management
* management2
* management-stage
* policy
* policies
* mobile
* mobile-policy
* cyberacquisitions
* datacenters
* software
* sourcecode
* project-open-source
* agile
* techfarhub
* itmf
* a130

Generally the purpose of these sites has been one of three things:
* to solicit public feedback on a draft policy
* to present a user friendly version of a finalized policy
* to provide implementation guidance and other materials related to a policy to help with implementation

The goal of this site will be to provide some support for each of those use cases in the context of a clear information architecture.
