      <h3 class="usa-alert-heading">We've Moved!</h3>
      <p class="usa-alert-text">Thank you for participating in this initial effort to digitize OFCIO's inventory of IT policies.</p>
    <p>OFCIO is proud to announce that this site has been replaced with the next generation of digital policy database.</p>
 <p>We have been behind the scenes breaking down all of our IT policies, picking out down to their individual requirments, stripped out their fluff, and made it searchable. More than 8,500 requirements from hundreds of Federal IT policies can now be found, compared, searched, and printed from there:</p>
      <h4>[Visit the New Site](https://policy-beta.cio.gov).</h4>
      <p>As a result, this site will be retired on August 15, 2017.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>PolicyLibrary@omb.eop.gov</p>
