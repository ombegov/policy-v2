Common user interface components and visual styles help create a seamless transition across an agencyâ€™s websites and improve the ease with which the public can find information.
Federal Agencies should ensure a consistent look and feel of their public facing websites and digital services. 
The U.S. Website Design Standards, found at [https://standards.usa.gov/getting-started/](https://standards.usa.gov/getting-started/), is available to all agencies to assist with this process.
