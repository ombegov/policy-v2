| :------------- |:-------------|
__Security Risks__ |__Security categorization__: Moderate or high potential impact rating based on an agency’s Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) 199 security categorization assessment<br /> __Sensitivity__: Relationship of the system to the priority high value asset (HVA) list identified as part of the Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan (CSIP)<br /> __Past incidents__: Incidents involving the system that have been reported to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)<br /> __Compliance__: Inability of the system to meet relevant guidelines issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) – examples include the inability, because of cost or technical incompatibility, to implement multi-factor authentication or storage encryption where recommended or required<br /> __Support__: Use of hardware, software, or firmware components no longer supported by developers, vendors, or manufacturers through the availability of software patches, firmware updates, replacement parts, and maintenance contracts<br /> __Documented deficiencies__: Security risks within the system documented in reports (including the FISMA report to Congress), by an agency’s office of inspector general, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), or other organizations|
|Operational Risks|__Mission criticality__: Degree to which core mission functions of the agency or other agencies are dependent upon the system<br /> __Impact__: Relationship of the system to the OMB High Impact List <br /> __Cost__: Rising costs associated with maintaining the system due to age or technical obsolescence<br /> __Human capital__: Difficulty in maintaining necessary staff with skill sets relevant to the system<br /> __Documented deficiencies__: Operational risks within the system documented in reports by an agency’s office of inspector general, the GAO, or other organizations<br /> __Operational stability__: Inability of the system to routinely achieve service-level requirements for uptime, availability, or response time <br />	__Technical friction__:  Operational or budgetary limitations on modifying the system due to technical complexity, complex dependencies, or obsolescence <br /> __Data integrity__: Inability of the system to maintain valid, consistent, or projected data requirements <br /> __System integration__: Inability of the system to interface cleanly with other components in the agency’s Enterprise Roadmap or IRM Strategic Plann valid, consistent, or projected data requirements |
| Modernization Impact|<br /> __Savings potential__: Anticipated reductions in operations and maintenance (O&M) cost due to efficiencies gained by moving to modern architectures <br /> __Reuse potential__: Anticipated agency-wide reuse of new technologies, including replacing multiple legacy systems with a single common platform <br /> __Business process simplification__: Anticipated simplification, consolidation, or streamlining of underlying business processes, including complex, duplicative, or fragmented processes <br /> __Functionality improvement__: Anticipated improvements to the quality of interactions and engagement with the public, businesses, other levels of government, and Federal employees |
| Execution Ability | __Program management maturity__: Degree to which the agency has a sustained track record of successful delivery of IT systems and the means to ensure the proper methods are used to effectively plan and manage modernization initiatives<br /> __Governance maturity__: Maturity level of agency governance framework to ensure proper continued oversight and adjustments to a modernization initiative <br /> __Modernization strategy maturity__: Degree to which modernization of the system aligns with priorities described in the agency’s Modernization Strategy and Sequencing Plan <br /> __Execution readiness__: Degree to which personnel, hardware, and software infrastructure and processes are in place to carry out this modernization
