Of the $82 billion in Federal IT spending planned for fiscal year (FY) 2017, approximately 78 percent ($63 billion) is classified as “legacy” IT spending – that is, spending dedicated to maintaining the existing IT portfolio, excluding provisioned services such as cloud.<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>  These systems may pose serious security risks, such as the inability to utilize current security best practices, including data encryption and multi-factor authentication. Further, unsupported commercial software may be impossible to update. Operational risks arise when these systems cannot adapt to current or expected mission requirements, user needs, operating environments, or are no longer cost justifiable. In these cases, modernization would improve the ability of these systems to deliver the necessary levels of functionality, security, and efficiency to satisfy the needs of agency users, stakeholders, and the American public.

Agency efforts to modernize existing IT systems have faced substantial challenges. The high costs and risks associated with modernization efforts, combined with the increasing cost to maintain existing systems, is harming agencies’ ability to manage their portfolio of IT systems strategically and deliver the functionality needed to achieve their missions.  In addition, given the presence of significant interdependencies between agency IT systems, challenges in modernizing one system often have ripple effects across the agency’s IT portfolio, and in some instances, across the Federal Government.
