#### April 6, 2018 ####

### M-18-XX ###

### From: Mick Mulvaney, Director, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) ###

### SUBJECT: Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Agencies through Improved Identity, Credential, and Access Management ###

> The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is proposing a new policy to address Federal agencies’ implementation of Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) – the security disciplines that enable the right individual to access the right resource, at the right time, for the right reason.

> _Comments may be submitted by creating an issue on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/ombegov/policy-v2/labels/identity-draft) for this draft policy or by emailing the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer at [ofcio@omb.eop.gov](mailto:ofcio@omb.eop.gov)_

Agencies must be able to identify, credential, monitor, and manage user access to information and information systems across their enterprise in order to ensure secure and efficient operations. In particular, how agencies conduct identity proofing,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> establish digital identities, and adopt sound processes for authentication and access control will significantly impact the security of their digital services. Additionally, as information about individuals becomes more widely available through social media or through breaches of personally identifiable information (PII), it is increasingly important that all agencies adopt identity validation solutions that enhance privacy and mitigate negative impacts to delivery of digital services and maintenance of online trust. It is also essential that agencies’ Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) strategies and solutions are informed by risk perspectives and driven by targeted outcomes.

This memorandum sets forth the ICAM policy, providing agencies with guidance to strengthen the security of information and information systems. Specifically, it elaborates on three main areas: 


1. Implementation of effective ICAM governance; 
2. Modernization of agency ICAM capabilities; and
3. Agency adoption of ICAM shared solutions and services.

This memorandum also outlines government-wide ICAM responsibilities, and updates previous requirements in areas such as multi-factor authentication, encryption, digital signatures, acquisition, and interoperability. 

### Implementation of Effective ICAM Governance ###

Establishing effective ICAM governance is an important part of the federal government’s continual efforts to promote robust cybersecurity. To ensure effective governance, agencies shall leverage the approaches and principles of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63, <i>Digital Identity Guidelines</i>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Agencies shall also continue to follow Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) requirements pertaining to the identity verification and credentialing of federal employees and contractors.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> 

To reach these goals, agencies shall: 

1. Define and implement ICAM policies, processes, and technology solutions that encompass the agency’s entire enterprise, align with the government-wide Federal ICAM Enterprise Architecture, and meet Federal policies, standards, and guidelines;<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> 

2. Designate an integrated ICAM office, team, or other governance structure in support of its Enterprise Risk Management capability that includes personnel from the offices of the Chief Information Officer, Chief Security Officer, Human Resources, General Counsel, Senior Agency Official for Privacy, and component organizations that manage ICAM programs and capabilities. These offices, as well as program managers and acquisition offices, should regularly coordinate to ensure that the agency’s ICAM policies, processes, and technologies are being implemented, maintained and managed consistently. This includes coordinating the deployment of capabilities and functionality provided through the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) Program;<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> 

3. Outline enterprise-level performance expectations for cybersecurity and privacy risk management throughout each user’s lifecycle, including changes in the user’s access privileges;

4. Develop a mechanism to streamline and automate enterprise-level performance reporting. This mechanism should align with existing and planned reporting and analytics structures and tools, such as the CDM dashboards and FISMA reporting; and 

5. Incorporate Digital Identity Risk Management<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> into existing processes as outlined in NIST SP 800-63, including the selection of Identity Assurance Levels (IALs), Authentication Assurance Levels (AALs), and Federation Assurance Levels (FALs) commensurate with the risk to their digital service offerings.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> 

> - Agencies shall use these levels to make risk-informed decisions when selecting and using technologies implemented across the ICAM environment; and 

> - Agencies should share “Digital Identity Acceptance Statements” with NIST to drive improvements to NIST SP 800-63 where applicable. 


### Modernization of Agency ICAM Capabilities ###

It is imperative that agencies implement and harmonize their ICAM capabilities, while ensuring that ICAM solutions are not fragmented or duplicative. To achieve this objective, agencies shall take the following steps to modernize their ICAM architecture:

1. *Reduce Solution Overlap*: Agencies shall establish authoritative solutions for their ICAM services,  promoting the most effective solutions at an enterprise level.

2. *Promote Innovation through Modularity*: Agencies shall ensure that deployed ICAM capabilities are interchangeable and developed based on open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and/or commercial standards to promote interoperability and enable componentized development.

### Agency Adoption of ICAM Shared Solutions and Services ###

Common shared solutions and services have been created or are in development across government to support the accelerated adoption of modern ICAM capabilities. Agencies should begin moving to ICAM shared services and should plan to incorporate new services once they are available. Current and planned shared services include:

1.*Credential Management Services*: The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Shared Service Provider Program to enable strong government oversight of service providers offering digital certificates for identity and authentication.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup> Use of the PKI shared service, with standard contract language, will allow for coordinated security management and oversight and is intended to reduce the complexity of contract management at the agency level. It will also facilitate compliance with NIST standards and guidelines and Federal PKI (FPKI)<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup> policy requirements developed by the Federal CIO Council.

> - Agencies should leverage approved contract vehicles to procure digital certificates for identification and authentication.

2.*Accelerating the Deployment of ICAM Capabilities*: The CDM program enhances the overall security posture of the federal government by providing Federal agencies with capabilities to reduce the attack surface of their respective networks, identify cybersecurity risks, and enable agencies to prioritize actions to mitigate or accept cybersecurity risks based on the potential impacts to their mission. CDM accomplishes this by working with agencies to deploy commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) tools on agency networks that provide enterprise-wide visibility of what assets, users, and activities are on their networks. This actionable information allows agencies to effectively monitor, defend, and rapidly respond to cyber incidents.

> - Agencies shall leverage the CDM Program to accelerate their procurement and deployment of tools aligned to ICAM capabilities.


3.*Identity Assurance and Authentication Service for Consumers*: Improving the trust and safety of consumer transactions across the federal government is critical to digital service delivery. Shared identity assurance and authentication services, which enhance online trust and safety, will enable a streamlined customer experience and are expected to reduce costs and improve security and privacy for stored PII.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup> Agencies should leverage private- or public-sector shared services, to the extent available, to achieve these objectives.

> - Agencies shall use shared service providers that align with NIST SP 800-63 security and privacy requirements;

> - Agencies should use shared service providers that are able to federate with other solutions so that customers are empowered to select the option that appropriately mitigates risk for their unique interactions across government; and

> - Agencies should use shared service providers that leverage more than one credential provider to provide resiliency in case of a compromise or other service failure with a credential provider.

*4.Identity Assurance and Authentication Services for Businesses and Partners*: The federal government has supported the establishment of federated identity frameworks including FPKI, healthcare information exchanges, defense, homeland security, higher education and law enforcement. These initiatives serve as the foundation for trust between agencies and their business and mission partners. Delivered through a centralized governance model, these capabilities support an agencies’ ability to choose its capability, improve usability, and support partnerships used to deliver services.

> - Agencies shall only accept externally issued credentials that are issued in accordance with NIST guidelines and federal government-wide ICAM requirements.


### Government-wide Responsibilities ###

The following agencies lead Government-wide efforts to improve the management and use of digital identity. 

The Department of Commerce is responsible for implementing the following actions:

1. Develop and issue guidance to promote deployment of technology, including those in open source that address agency digital identity needs such as derived Personal Identity Verification (PIV) and other credentials;

2. Establish and develop implementation guidance for identity federation protocol(s) for use cases such as Government-to-Business that support various authenticators and identity proofing components in alignment with NIST SP 800-63;

3. Develop criteria, in coordination with GSA, for approving products that meet the assurance levels outlined in NIST SP 800-63; 

4. Update NIST SP 800-157, *Guidelines for Derived PIV Credentials*, to align with NIST SP 800-63 and develop a process to identify innovative technologies and authenticators (where applicable) that can leverage the PIV process for derived credentialing for logical and physical access; and

5. Utilize feedback, such as Digital Identity Acceptance Statements, provided by agencies to make improvements to NIST SP 800-63 and other guidance.

The General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible for implementing the following actions:

1. Maintain and support the evolution of the government-wide FICAM Architecture and associated guidance, previously published in the FICAM Roadmap and Implementation Guidance, v2.0: FICAM Playbooks, and establish and maintain a repository for agency best practices; 

2. Manage the FIPS 201 Evaluation Program and associated Approved Products List (APL) to provide compliant and interoperable solutions for logical and physical access control, including the development of test criteria;<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup>

3. Establish a capability for approving products that meet assurance levels in NIST SP 800-63 leveraging the criteria developed by NIST;

4. Provide a solution for consumer identity assurance and authentication, such as Login.gov, and establish a Technical Review Board composed of agency customers and OMB, who will provide feedback and develop customer outcome metrics to inform the solution roadmap. The feedback should be made publicly available for incorporation by agencies and shared service providers;

5. Maintain the FPKI Program to provide government with a trust framework and infrastructure to administer digital certificates and public-private key pairs;

6. Develop and publish, in consultation with NIST, OPM, and DHS, a Physical Access Control System (PACS) security and privacy control overlay<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup> to help agencies identify core controls for PACS; and

7. Determine the feasibility of expanding the USAccess program to include Derived PIV Credentials as a service offering. For those agencies not leveraging a Federal shared service for Derived PIV credentials, the FIPS 201 Evaluation Program shall establish a process so agencies may ensure the credentials they are using meet the technical specifications outlined in NIST SP 800-157.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible for the following actions:

1. Update, as necessary, Federal PIV credential eligibility and vetting requirements for non-U.S. National and temporary agency employees; and<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup>

All questions or inquiries should be addressed to the OMB Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (OFCIO) via email: [ofcio@omb.eop.gov](mailto:ofcio@omb.eop.gov).

## Attachment: Foundational ICAM Requirements ##

This attachment outlines additional agency requirements that are essential to achieving a vision for use of common services across government. 

Listed below are the vetting and authentication requirements for the credentialing of users with access to Federally-controlled facilities and Federal information systems. Agencies shall implement processes to issue credentials in a timely manner to reduce potential loss of productivity.

### Credentialing ###

#### Federal Employees and Contractors ####

Employees and contractors who require long-term<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">19</a></sup> access to Federally-controlled facilities or Federal information systems fall under the scope of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 and shall be issued a PIV credential in accordance with relevant policy, standards and guidelines.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup> Agencies should refer to OMB M-05-24 for additional HSPD-12 applicability requirements.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup>

Agencies should support the use of Derived PIV Credentials for Federal employees, contractors and other users and enable applications on mobile devices to accept them. As Derived PIV Credential service offerings are approved in accordance with the established FIPS 201 requirements, the GSA Approved Products List shall include these solutions for agency use. 

#### Non-U.S. National Federal Employees and Contractors ####

For non-U.S. national employees and contractors who require long-term access to Federally-controlled facilities or Federal information systems but are unable to complete the standard background investigation requirements, agencies shall follow the alternative credentialing standards outlined in OPM policy.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup> In addition, persons shall meet eligibility requirements based upon the background checks and other requirements specified in the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Credentialing Standards. Before the alternative identity credential may be issued, the agency must adhere to the vetting requirements outlined in OPM policy. 

#### Applicability of HSPD-12 to Other Individuals ####

Applicability of HSPD-12 requirements to other agency specific categories of individuals (e.g., short-term (i.e., less than 6 months) guest researchers; volunteers; or intermittent, temporary or seasonal employees) is an agency risk-based decision. Background investigations and identity proofing of these individuals shall follow OPM and NIST standards. To ensure interoperability and reduce costs, it is recommended that credentials issued to these individuals leverage the PIV infrastructure.

#### Interoperability, Reciprocity, and Revocation of Credentials ####

Agencies shall implement processes to determine if an employee or contractor already possesses a valid PIV credential and leverage the existing, valid PIV credential rather than issuing a separate one, where feasible. Agency processes shall accept and electronically verify PIV credentials issued by other agencies. This is equally applicable for local and physical access where another agency’s employee has been provisioned access. Agencies shall also implement processes to revoke or destroy credentials in a timely manner to prevent instances of unauthorized access when the credential has been compromised, the employee or contractor has been terminated, or the credential is lost.

#### Acquisition of Products and Services ####

To ensure government-wide interoperability of facility and system access control solutions, agencies shall acquire products and services that are approved to be compliant with OMB policy, NIST standards and supporting technical specifications, and included on the GSA FIPS 201 Approved Products List (APL). 

The GSA serves as the executive agency for Government-wide acquisitions of information technology related to identity management initiatives.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">23</a></sup> In this capacity, GSA maintains the GSA FIPS 201 Evaluation Program, which was developed to organize and define a standardized approval process for PIV products and services. 

The Federal Acquisition Regulation, FAR, 48 C.F.R. Subpart 4.13, requires agencies to comply with FIPS 201 for contractors who require routine logical or physical access and include language to this effect in applicable solicitations and contracts. The FAR also requires that agencies purchase only approved products and services in support of their PIV implementations. All required NIST validation and GSA testing shall be met to be an approved product or service for PIV purchases. Approved products and services, which have been demonstrated to meet NIST validation and GSA testing and have been qualified by the Evaluation Program, can be found on the APL. The APL can be accessed at: <a href="https://www.idmanagement.gov">https://www.idmanagement.gov</a>

#### Credential Use ####

PIV credentials shall be used as the standard means of authentication for Federal employee and contractor access to Federal information systems.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote">24</a></sup> All systems under development shall be enabled to integrate with PIV credentials, in accordance with NIST guidelines, prior to being made operational. Additionally, when procuring services or upgrading existing systems, agencies shall require that these services or systems be enabled to use PIV credentials for authentication.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote">25</a></sup> 

1. When PIV cards as a form factor are not feasible for logical access control, other IAL 3 and Authenticator AAL 3 identity solutions can be used. Agencies shall consider the cross-government trusted federation and interoperability requirements established in HSPD-12 when implementing any other process and form factor.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote">26</a></sup> 

2. Agencies shall require the use of the digital signature capability of PIV credentials capabilities in accordance with FPKI policy, and NIST standards and guidelines. For individuals that fall outside the scope of PIV applicability, agencies should leverage approved FPKI credentials when using digital signatures.

3. Agencies should use the PIV credential as a means to encrypt information. Agencies shall encrypt Federal information at rest and in transit unless otherwise protected by alternative physical and logical safeguards implemented at multiple layers, including networks, systems, applications, and data, when the assessed risk indicates the need.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote">27</a></sup>

#### Physical Access Control Requirements ####

Agencies shall require use of the PIV credentials as the common means of authentication for Federal employee and contractor access to Federally-controlled facilities. Agencies shall ensure that use of the PIV credential for physical access to Federal buildings are implemented in accordance with *The Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities: An Interagency Security Committee Standard* and NIST SP 800-116, *A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in Physical Access Control Systems (PACS)*. This publication provides additional information on the use of PIV Credentials, the Government-wide standard identity credential, in physical access control systems.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote">28</a></sup>


### Citizens, Business Partners, and Other Partners ###

This section addresses the management of citizens, business partners, and other partners’ identities requiring access to Federal information systems. It is imperative that agencies ensure these users are properly authenticated using an authenticator at the appropriate AAL bound to an identity proofed at the appropriate IAL. Agencies shall:

1. Require these users to leverage a credential at the appropriate AAL, in conjunction with the appropriate IAL, in accordance with NIST SP 800-63;

2. Ensure that identity proofing for users is conducted in accordance with Federal standards and guidelines at the appropriate IAL;

3. Leverage existing credentials and identity federations at the acceptable AAL, IAL, and FAL rather than standing up processes or capabilities to issue new credentials to these users;

4. Acquire approved products and services that that have been demonstrated to meet Federal policy, standards, and supporting technical specifications by the GSA FIPS 201 Evaluation Program and made available on the Approved Products List; and

5. Implement robust practices and technologies for the efficient, secure management of user identity data and minimize the collection and storage of user identity data to only the data necessary to manage access and detect fraud while protecting it using Federally-approved encryption method.
