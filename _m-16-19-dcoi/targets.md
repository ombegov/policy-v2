OMB will measure agency progress for this initiative using the following optimization, cost savings, and closure metrics and goals on a quarterly basis, by way of agencies’ quarterly data center inventory submissions. These optimization, cost-savings, and closure metrics and goals apply to all data centers at agency facilities. 

## Goal 1: Optimization

The following optimization metrics are listed in order of priority. Agencies shall achieve and maintain all listed target values by the end of fiscal year 2018:

Only the Server Utilization & Automated Monitoring optimization metric shall apply to non-tiered data centers. High-performance computing (HPC) nodes can be excluded from calculations of Virtualization and Server Utilization & Automated Monitoring.

## Goal 2: Cost Savings and Avoidance

Agencies shall, by the end of fiscal year 2018, reduce Government-wide annual costs attributable to physical data centers by at least 25%, relative to the fiscal year 2016 IT Infrastructure Spending data submitted to the Federal IT Dashboard<sup>[29](29)</sup>. Agencies shall collectively achieve the following amounts of savings (combined cost savings and cost avoidance)<sup>[30](30)</sup> in each of fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018:

| Table 2. Cost Savings,Target         |                                    |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| FY2014 Physical Data,Center Spending | Total Savings Targeted by FYE 2018 |
| $5.4 billion                         | $2.7 billion                       |

Only the Server Utilization & Automated Monitoring optimization metric shall apply to non-tiered data centers. High-performance computing (HPC) nodes can be excluded from calculations of Virtualization and Server Utilization & Automated Monitoring.


### Goal 3: Closed Data Centers

In all cases, the term “closed” for data centers shall refer exclusively to tiered or non-tiered data centers that: a) no longer consume power for physical servers; or b) no longer house physical servers (whether in a production, test, stage, development, or any other environment)<sup>[31](31)</sup>. 

Based on the number of data centers designated by the agencies as already undergoing some part of the closure process, agencies currently plan to close 22% of tiered data centers and 50% of non-tiered, non-cloud data centers, for a total of 44% of all Federal data centers. OMB’s goal for the DCOI is informed by, but exceeds, agencies’ existing closure plans.

By the end of fiscal year 2018, agencies shall close at least 25% of tiered data centers government-wide, excluding those approved as inter-agency shared services provider data centers. Furthermore, agencies must close at least 60% of non-tiered data centers government-wide.<sup>[32](32)</sup> This target will result in the closure of approximately 52% of the overall Federal data center inventory and a reduction of approximately 31% <sup>[33](33)</sup> in the gross floor area occupied by data centers government-wide. Agencies shall prioritize the closure of data centers that are unable to meet applicable PUE optimization targets and/or pose management or security challenges due to age. 

In the long term, all agencies should continually strive to close all non-tiered data centers. Server rooms and closets pose security risks and management challenges and are an inefficient use of resources. As such, although at least 60% of non-tiered data centers are required to be closed before the end of fiscal year 2018, OMB expects that agencies will consider all such facilities as temporary and work to close them.

Within 30 days after publication of this document, OMB OFCIO will share with each agency its individual goal for data center closures, specifying the respective number of tiered and non-tiered data centers the agency must close. OMB may exclude from these agency-specific targets data centers that are physically inseparable from non-IT hardware (e.g. simulation and modeling devices, sensors, etc.) and that perform a specific, non-standard set of tasks (e.g. do not provide general purpose computing or storage services to Federal facilities).
