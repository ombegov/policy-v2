Over the past year OFCIO has analyzed IT policies and tagged requirements according to the Policy Schema taxonomies which are detailed [here]( https://policy.cio.gov/taxonomies/).  

Over the next year we will be working with [18F](18f.gsa.gov) to develop a web policy library based on the populated schema.  In the meantime, the content is available for download here.

The data is currently divided into three phases- Phase 1 is complete, Phase 2 is being validated by subject matter experts, and Phase 3 is currently being analyzed.  We'll post updated datasets as they become available.
