Minimization.\nWhen dealing with paper records, it may be difficult to provide only certain data elements to other agencies, because of the need for manual redaction of other information. In the computer world, it is far easier to implement sharing of only a narrow range of information that is necessary to verify an applicant's eligibility for a program. Agencies should analyze what data are needed for program purposes and make every effort to ensure that they transfer only that information.\n\n7. Accountability.\nData sharing programs should include mechanisms to ensure that agencies are accountable for adhering to these principles. Some of these measures are already found in the Privacy Act, which provides for civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance. Agencies should also consider training programs that stress accountability and explain penalties for breaches of confidentiality. Especially for more sensitive data and more extensive data sharing arrangements, agencies should consider whether additional oversight mechanisms, such as self-audits, are justified.\n\nFor example, agencies should establish procedures to ensure compliance with redisclosure limitations. One mechanism for assuring compliance would be to have the recipient agency certify on a periodic basis that it has examined practices regarding redisclosure and, if necessary, taken corrective action where improper redisclosures have occurred.\n\n8. Privacy Impact Assessments.\nIn the President's FY2001 budget, the President announced an initiative to make \"privacy impact assessments,\" or \"PIAs,\" a regular part of the development of new Government computer systems. A PIA is a plan to build privacy protection into new information systems, such as, for example, by asking systems personnel and program personnel to work through questions on data needs and data protection before the system is developed. The CIO Council has voted the IRS PIA a best practice; it is available as a reference at http:\/\/www.cio.gov.",

					"reqText": "Step 1:  Conduct a risk assessment of the e-government system.  Guidance for agencies in conducting risk assessments is available in A-130, Section 5 of OMB\u2019s GPEA guidance and existing NIST guidance. The risk assessment will measure the relative severity of the potential harm and likelihood of occurrence of a wide range of impacts (to any party) associated with the e-government system in the event of an identity authentication error.\nNote: An E-government system may have multiple categories or types of transactions, which may require separate analysis within the overall risk assessment.  An E-government system may also span multiple agencies whose activities may require separate consideration.\nRisk analysis is to some extent a subjective process, in which agencies must consider harms that might result from, among other causes, technical failures, malevolent third parties, public misunderstandings, and human error.  Agencies should consider a wide range of possible scenarios in seeking to determine what potential harms are associated with their business process.  It is better to be over-inclusive than under-inclusive in conducting this analysis.  Once risks have been identified, there may also be ways to adjust the business process to mitigate particular risks by reducing the likelihood that they will occur (see Step 4).\nStep 2:  Map identified risks to the required assurance level.  The risk assessment should be summarized in terms of the potential impact categories in Section 2.2.\nTo determine the required assurance level, agencies should initially identify risks inherent in the transaction process, regardless of its authentication technology.  Agencies should then tie the potential impact category outcomes to the authentication level, choosing the lowest level of authentication that will cover all of potential impacts identified.  Thus, if five categories of potential impact are appropriate for Level 1, and one category of potential impact is appropriate for Level 2, the transaction would require a Level 2 authentication.  For example, if the misuse of a user\u2019s electronic identity\/credentials during a medical procedure presents a risk of serious injury or death, map to the risk profile identified under Level 4, even if other consequences are minimal.\n\nStep 3:  Select technology based on the NIST e-authentication technical guidance. After determining the assurance level, the agency should refer to the NIST e-authentication\n \ntechnical guidance to identify and implement the appropriate technical requirements.\n\nStep 4: After implementation, validate that the information system has operationally achieved the required assurance level.  Because some implementations may create or compound particular risks, conduct a final validation to confirm that the system achieves the required assurance level for the user-to-agency process. The agency should validate that the authentication process satisfies the systems\u2019s authentication requirements as part of required security procedures (e.g., certification and accreditation).\n\nStep 5: Periodically reassess the information system to determine technology refresh requirements.  The agency must periodically reassess the information system to ensure that the identity authentication requirements continue to be valid as a result of technology changes or changes to the agency\u2019s business processes. Annual information security assessment requirements provide an excellent opportunity for this. Agencies may adjust the identity credential\u2019s level of assurance using additional risk mitigation measures. Easing identity credential assurance level requirements may increase the size of the enabled customer pool, but agencies must ensure that this does not corrupt the system\u2019s choice of the appropriate assurance level.\n",

Additionally, clear deliverables should be monitored closely and any delays in deliverables should automatically result in a more in-depth review of a project.

Historically, Federal government IT projects have involved expansive, long-term projects that attempt to change almost every aspect of a business system at once. These projects have taken years, sometimes a decade, and have failed at alarming rates. The best practice in IT project design now focuses on the development of an overall, high-level system architecture with specific development projects working on tight timetables with clear deliverables that provide interim functionality.

OMB expects the requirements to re-scope agency modernization projects contained in this guidance will enable greater adoption of shared service arrangements with lower risk and greater cost impacts.

If the contractor is found to have made any materially false or fraudulent statements or representations, it may be subject to penalties under the False Statement Act. This should make contractors clearly accountable for delivering what they promise. OMB will, as appropriate, revisit this policy on an annual basis to determine the potential need for refinement. Additional details related to this change to the testing process will be provided in an upcoming revision to OMB CircularA-127, scheduled to be issued this summer, as well as the OMB Audit Bulletin.",

Pursuant to that objective, agencies shall take the following steps: \n1. Identify agency high-risk IT projects, \n2. Develop improvement plans for these projects, and \n3. Present improvement plans in TechStat sessions. The steps of this process are detailed below. \n\n1. Identify Agency High-Risk IT Projects \nThe Federal CIO will select, collaboratively with agency CIOs, the high-risk IT projects across the Federal Government. Using the IT Dashboard and other sources of information, agency CIOs shall describe the risk profile of the largest, most complex IT projects. Risk factors would include: - Significant cost or schedule variance from the current baseline\n- Performance targets or mission objectives have not been met, \n- Frequent re-baselines, or \n- Lack of essential executive sponsorship\/leadership.\n\nThe Federal CIO will schedule individual sessions with agency CIOs (as outlined in attachment A), between August 2 and August 18, to identify the highest risk projects across the Federal IT portfolio. The list of high-risk projects will be finalized by August 23. It is anticipated that 25 to 30 projects will be selected across the Federal government.\n\n2. Develop Improvement Plans\nAgencies shall submit a proposed improvement plan for each high-risk project. Agencies\nshall submit proposed improvement plans to OMB no later than 30 days after their high-risk\nprojects are identified. While formal improvement plans are only required for these projects, agency CIOs are accountable for the performance of the entire IT portfolio, not limited to just the high-risk projects. Therefore, similar improvement plans should be applied to other high-risk projects in an agency\u2019s entire IT portfolio. Agency proposed improvement plans should be based on thorough analysis of the projects\u2019 issues and risks. Plans should be comprehensive, risk-adjusted, and reviewed through appropriate agency governance bodies. The plan may incorporate short and long term solutions that may extend through Budget Year 2012. If the agency CIO does not have high confidence in the probability of success of the investment, the agency CIO should recommend that the project be materially altered or terminated.\n \nThe proposed improvement plan should include:\na. Major challenges and causes of variance from the project baseline,\nb. A summary of risks, mitigation strategies, and clear accountability,\nc. Stronger contractor performance metrics and controls for existing contracts, and revised\nacquisition strategies for contracts expected to be executed within the next fiscal year that\naddress the issues raised in the improvement plan,\nd. A high-level schedule that articulates critical path items,\ne. Agencies should describe how the project\u2019s governance will be more rigorous because of\nthe improvement plan. Agencies should also describe how they will improve both\ncontract and program management oversight internally to ensure better performance, and\nf. List the specific corrective actions to turn around the project.\n\n3. Present Improvement Plans in TechStat Sessions\nThe proposed improvement plans for the selected high-risk projects will be reviewed in\nOMB TechStat Accountability Sessions led by the Federal CIO. These sessions will be conducted between September and November. At the TechStat session, the agency will brief OMB on the improvement plans, revised schedules, and potential changes to budget requests.\n\nThe TechStat sessions will be used to inform OMB decisions on FY 2012 budget requests\nand potential FY 2011 apportionments. TechStat sessions will also provide feedback and\nrecommendations to agencies concerning project scope, management and oversight. ",

The definition of PII is not anchored to any single category of information or technology. Rather, it requires a case-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified. In performing this assessment, it is important for an agency to recognize that non-PIT can become PII whenever additional information is made publicly available (in any medium and from any source) that, when combined with other available information, could be used to identify an individual. \nMosaic effect: The mosaic effect occurs when the information in an individual dataset, in isolation, may not pose a risk of identifying an individual (or threatening some other important interest such as security), but when combined with other available information, could pose such risk. Before disclosing potential PIT or other potentially sensitive information, agencies must consider other publicly available data - in any medium and from any source- to determine whether some combination of existing data and the data\nintended to be' publicly released could allow for the identification of an individual or pose another security\nconcern.

In general, open data will be consistent with the following principles: \n\u2022 Public. Consistent with OMB's Open Government Directive, agencies must adopt a presumption in favor of openness to the extent permitted  by law and subject to privacy, confidentiality, security, or other valid restrictions. \n\u2022 Accessible. Open data are made available in convenient, modifiable, and open formats  that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched. Formats should be machine-readable (i.e., data are reasonably structured to allow automated processing). Open data structures do not discriminate against any person or group of persons and should be made available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes, often by providing the data in multiple formats for consumption. To the extent permitted by law, these formats should be non-proprietary, publicly available, and no restrictions should be placed upon their use. \n\u2022 Described. Open data are described fully so that consumers of the data have sufficient information to understand their strengths, weaknesses, analytical limitations, security requirements, as well as how to process them. This involves the use of robust, granular metadata (i.e., fields or elements that describe data), thorough documentation of data elements, data dictionaries, and, if applicable, additional descriptions of the purpose of the collection, the population of interest, the characteristics of the sample, and the method of data collection.\n\u2022 Reusable. Open data are made available under an open license that places no restrictions on their use. \n\u2022 Complete. Open data are published in primary forms (i.e., as collected at the source), with the finest possible level of granularity that is practicable and permitted by law and other requirements. Derived or aggregate open data should also be published but must reference the primary data . \n\u2022 Timely. Open data are made available as quickly as necessary to preserve the value of the data. Frequency of release should account for key audiences and downstream needs. \n\u2022 Managed Post-Release. A point of contact must be designated to assist with data use and to respond to complaints about adherence to these open data requirements.",

					"reqText": "Section 508 of the Rehabi litation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (E&IT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that Federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs, which reduces barriers to job success and mobility. The law also helps to ensure that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. The purpose of this letter is to remind Chief Acquisition Officers (CAOs) and Chief Information Officers (CIOs) of their collaborative roles in this area and to suggest activities and tools to help agencies fulfill their responsibilities in implementing the law. \n\nThe Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires agencies to acquire accessible E&IT unless an exception applies and is documented. Consideration of the Section 508 standards must be part of the procurement planning process, market research, and requirements definition, and the standards must be included in all applicable solicitations. The General Services Administration (GSA), as part of their statutory requirement to provide technical support for Section 508, assesses the extent to which agencies properly include applicable Section 508 standards using a sampling process of solicitations posted on FedBizOpps over the past few months. Across all agencies, a recent assessment by GSA showed that only 3% of the solicitations that included E&IT properly included the Section 508 standards. While some of the solicitations sampled included references to Section 508, a compliant document must, among other requirements, articulate the specific 508 standards that apply to that solicitation. \n\nThese results demonstrate we are not adequately incorporating applicable Section 508 standards when acquiring E&IT. CAOs and CIOs should review their procurement and information technology acquisition policies and procedures to validate that the Section 508 standards are appropriately considered and clearly stated in solicitation documents. CAOs should consider sampling agency procurements that include E&IT to ensure they properly specify the appropriate Section 508 standards. Procurements that do not meet the standards should be amended. The attachment includes the assessment criteria that GSA uses, and CAOs should consider using these or similar criteria in their sampling effort. \n\nCIOs also have specific obligations to help ensure the applicable Section 508 standards are included in procurements for E&IT. Section 8(b)(xiii) of OMB Circular A- 130, \u201cManagement of Federal Information Resources,\u201d requires agencies to ensure selected systems or processes facilitate accessibility under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and CIOs are responsible for monitoring agency implementation.  Additionally, Sections 53 and 300 of OMB Circular A-11, \u201cPreparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget,\u201d instruct agencies to ensure IT capital planning and control comply with Section 508 requirements.2 CIOs should instruct agency project managers to review capital planning and investment control documentation for compliance with Section 508. \n\nAs part of its ongoing technical assistance and sampling activities, GSA\u2019s Office of Information Technology Accessibility and Workforce may contact your Section 508 coordinator and the points of contact listed in solicitations that appear not to be compliant to offer additional assistance. \n\nA resource available to agencies is the Buy Accessible Wizard at www.buyaccessible.gov. This free tool guides requiring officials through the steps necessary to conduct acquisitions that comply with Section 508. CAOs and CIOs may incorporate the use of this tool into their procurement procedures to improve compliance with the law. Another resource is www.Section508.gov, which has information and free on-line training courses.",
