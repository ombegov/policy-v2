FFMIA Compliance,A. Definition of Substantial Compliance,"Substantial compliance is achieved when an agency’s financial management systems routinely provide reliable and timely financial information for managing day-to-day operations as well as to produce reliable financial statements, maintain effective internal control, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements. FFMIA substantial compliance will be determined annually at the department-wide or agency-wide level for the 24 major CFO Act agencies. Agencies can determine whether the requirements are being met by applying the FFMIA risk model, which ranks risks from nominal to significant (See Figure 1). The risk indicators in the model assist agencies in determining whether reliable and consistent information is available for decision making. The higher the risk, the more likely the agency is non-compliant.

FFMIA Compliance,A. Definition of Substantial Compliance,"If agencies fall under a nominal risk category, then the risk of noncompliance is low. Meeting the indicators for nominal risk signals that substantial compliance is adequately supported and additional supporting information should not be necessary. However, during the course of its financial statements audit, the financial statement auditor may request additional information to support compliance or, at its discretion, perform further testing. If agencies are under a significant risk category, then they are not in compliance with FFMIA and must identify remediation plans and resolve them. Agencies under moderate risk may need to provide further information to support compliance. Specific guidance may be found in the FFMIA Implementation Guide of 2008.

Technology trends and product support schedules should be considered when projecting the useful life. The plan must also identify existing problems related to the current system.

Each financial management system plan must:
a. describe the existing financial management system architecture and any changes needed to implement a targeted architecture;
b. be consistent with the enterprise architecture, information resource management plan, and IT capital plan;
c. provide a strategy for maintaining adequacy, consistency, and timeliness of financial information;

Encouraging Innovation,Link R&D Frameworks to Infrastructure Development,"Under the leadership of the President’s cybersecurity policy official, in collaboration with other EOP entities and the ICI-IPC [Interagency Policy Committee], the Federal government should provide a framework for research and development strategies that focus on game-changing technologies that will help meet infrastructure objectives, building on the existing Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) strategies and other R&D-related work. The Federal government should greatly expand coordination of these strategies with industry and academic research efforts to avoid duplication, leverage and synchronize complementary capabilities and agendas, and ensure that technology transitions and enters into the marketplace.
• To enhance U.S. competitiveness, the Federal government should work with industry to develop migration paths and incentives for the rapid adoption of research and technology development, including encouragement of collaboration between academic and industrial laboratories.
• The Federal government, in collaboration with the private sector and other stakeholders, also should use the infrastructure objectives and the R&D framework to help define goals for national and international standards bodies.",Should,Cybersecurity policy official; EOP entities; ICI-IPC,NA,NA,,,,,x,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,

Encouraging Innovation,Establish Identity Management as an Option,"The Federal government - in collaboration with industry and the civil liberties and privacy communities - should build a cybersecurity-based identity management vision and strategy for the Nation that considers an array of approaches, including privacy-enhancing technologies. The Federal government must interact with citizens through myriad information, services, and benefit programs and thus has an interest in the protection of the public’s private information as well. Increased use of on-line transactions involving financial, health, and commerce require a basis for building trust between the parties to a transaction.
• The Nation should implement, for high-value activities (e.g., the Smart Grid), an opt-in array of interoperable identity management systems to build trust for online transactions and to enhance privacy.
• The National Science and Technology Council’s (NSTC’s) Subcommittee on Biometrics and Identity Management in 2008 published a report that provides a vision for future federal identity management and a series of research and development recommendations. The Federal government should use this report as a starting point for identity management strategies.

• Expand partnerships with State, local, and tribal governments and international partners to maximize the market influence of these procurements;
• Work with Congress to identify mechanisms that would enable departments and agencies - under appropriate, limited situations - to incorporate threat information into acquisition decisions; and

6. Minimization.
When dealing with paper records, it may be difficult to provide only certain data elements to other agencies, because of the need for manual redaction of other information. In the computer world, it is far easier to implement sharing of only a narrow range of information that is necessary to verify an applicant's eligibility for a program. Agencies should analyze what data are needed for program purposes and make every effort to ensure that they transfer only that information.

7. Accountability.
Data sharing programs should include mechanisms to ensure that agencies are accountable for adhering to these principles. Some of these measures are already found in the Privacy Act, which provides for civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance. Agencies should also consider training programs that stress accountability and explain penalties for breaches of confidentiality. Especially for more sensitive data and more extensive data sharing arrangements, agencies should consider whether additional oversight mechanisms, such as self-audits, are justified.

For example, agencies should establish procedures to ensure compliance with redisclosure limitations. One mechanism for assuring compliance would be to have the recipient agency certify on a periodic basis that it has examined practices regarding redisclosure and, if necessary, taken corrective action where improper redisclosures have occurred.

8. Privacy Impact Assessments.
In the President's FY2001 budget, the President announced an initiative to make ""privacy impact assessments,"" or ""PIAs,"" a regular part of the development of new Government computer systems. A PIA is a plan to build privacy protection into new information systems, such as, for example, by asking systems personnel and program personnel to work through questions on data needs and data protection before the system is developed. The CIO Council has voted the IRS PIA a best practice; it is available as a reference at http://www.cio.gov.",should,"Agencies, CXO Councils",None specified,(Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act an ammendment to the Privacy Act of 1974) 5 U.S.C.

Guidance for agencies in conducting risk assessments is available in A-130, Section 5 of OMB’s GPEA guidance and existing NIST guidance. The risk assessment will measure the relative severity of the potential harm and likelihood of occurrence of a wide range of impacts (to any party) associated with the e-government system in the event of an identity authentication error.
Note: An E-government system may have multiple categories or types of transactions, which may require separate analysis within the overall risk assessment.  An E-government system may also span multiple agencies whose activities may require separate consideration.
Risk analysis is to some extent a subjective process, in which agencies must consider harms that might result from, among other causes, technical failures, malevolent third parties, public misunderstandings, and human error.  Agencies should consider a wide range of possible scenarios in seeking to determine what potential harms are associated with their business process.  It is better to be over-inclusive than under-inclusive in conducting this analysis.  Once risks have been identified, there may also be ways to adjust the business process to mitigate particular risks by reducing the likelihood that they will occur (see Step 4).
Step 2:  Map identified risks to the required assurance level.  The risk assessment should be summarized in terms of the potential impact categories in Section 2.2.
To determine the required assurance level, agencies should initially identify risks inherent in the transaction process, regardless of its authentication technology.  Agencies should then tie the potential impact category outcomes to the authentication level, choosing the lowest level of authentication that will cover all of potential impacts identified.  Thus, if five categories of potential impact are appropriate for Level 1, and one category of potential impact is appropriate for Level 2, the transaction would require a Level 2 authentication.  For example, if the misuse of a user’s electronic identity/credentials during a medical procedure presents a risk of serious injury or death, map to the risk profile identified under Level 4, even if other consequences are minimal.

Step 3:  Select technology based on the NIST e-authentication technical guidance. After determining the assurance level, the agency should refer to the NIST e-authentication
 
technical guidance to identify and implement the appropriate technical requirements.

Step 4: After implementation, validate that the information system has operationally achieved the required assurance level.  Because some implementations may create or compound particular risks, conduct a final validation to confirm that the system achieves the required assurance level for the user-to-agency process. The agency should validate that the authentication process satisfies the systems’s authentication requirements as part of required security procedures (e.g., certification and accreditation).

Step 5: Periodically reassess the information system to determine technology refresh requirements.  The agency must periodically reassess the information system to ensure that the identity authentication requirements continue to be valid as a result of technology changes or changes to the agency’s business processes. Annual information security assessment requirements provide an excellent opportunity for this. Agencies may adjust the identity credential’s level of assurance using additional risk mitigation measures.

When considering prizes, agencies should select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Point solution prizes aim to reward and spur development of solutions for a particular, well-defined problem. NASA, for example, is using an online “innovation marketplace” with 180,000 participants to spur solutions to problems such as forecasting solar activity, keeping food fresh in space, and developing a compact aerobic device for astronauts. An advance market commitment may be one vehicle for spurring specific solutions by providing a commitment to purchase a product that does not yet exist.

When considering prizes, agencies should select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Exposition prizes help identify and promote a broad range of promising ideas and practices that may not otherwise attract attention, facilitating further development of the idea or practice by third parties. Successful exposition prizes can mobilize capital and institutions in support of ideas and practices developed during a prize competition.

When considering prizes, agencies should select the type of prize best able to accomplish the broader aim. Network prizes build networks and strengthen communities by organizing winners into new problem-solving communities that can deliver more impact than individual efforts.

Participation prizes create value during and after the competition – not through conferral of the prize award itself but through their role in encouraging contestants to change their behavior or develop new skills that may have beneficial effects during and beyond the competition. As part of his “Educate to Innovate” campaign, for example, President Obama has highlighted the FIRST robotics competitions, which engage over 200,000 students, and are designed to motivate young people to pursue opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

Historically, Federal government IT projects have involved expansive, long-term projects that attempt to change almost every aspect of a business system at once. These projects have taken years, sometimes a decade, and have failed at alarming rates. The best practice in IT project design now focuses on the development of an overall, high-level system architecture with specific development projects working on tight timetables with clear deliverables that provide interim functionality.

One of the benefits of the segmented approach outlined above is that it allows prioritization of needs and functionality. The most critical functionality can be delivered first while functions of lesser importance can be considered for subsequent delivery.

OMB expects the requirements to re-scope agency modernization projects contained in this guidance will enable greater adoption of shared service arrangements with lower risk and greater cost impacts. Further, financial management shared service efforts will now focus on the higher impact area of transaction processing.

At the same time, OMB has a number of
cybersecurity responsibilities, principally in connection with FISMA. The Cybersecurity Coordinator leads the interagency process for cybersecurity strategy and policy development. To clarify and avoid confusion, effective immediately, OMB will be responsible for the submission of the annual FISMA report to Congress, for the development and approval of the cybersecurity portions of the President’s Budget, for the traditional OMB budgetary and fiscal oversight of the agencies’ use of funds, and for coordination with the Cybersecurity Coordinator on all policy issues related to the prior three responsibilities. The Cybersecurity Coordinator will have visibility into DHS efforts to ensure Federal agency compliance with FISMA and will serve as the principal White House official to coordinate interagency cooperation with DHS cybersecurity efforts. Effective immediately, DHS will exercise primary responsibility within the executive branch for the operational aspects of Federal agency cybersecurity with respect to the Federal information systems that fall within FISMA under 44 U.S.C. §3543. In carrying out this responsibility and the accompanying activities, DHS shall be subject to general OMB oversight in accordance with July 6, 2010 Section 3543(a), and DHS shall be subject to the limitations and requirements that apply to OMB under Section 3543(b)-(c).

• overseeing the government-wide and agency-specific implementation of and reporting on cybersecurity policies and guidance; 
• overseeing and assisting government-wide and agency-specific efforts to provide adequate, risk-based and cost-effective cybersecurity; 
• overseeing the agencies’ compliance with FISMA and developing analyses for OMB to assist in the development of the FISMA annual report;

Pursuant to that objective, agencies shall take the following steps: 
1. Identify agency high-risk IT projects, 
2. Develop improvement plans for these projects, and 
3. Present improvement plans in TechStat sessions. The steps of this process are detailed below. 

1. Identify Agency High-Risk IT Projects 
The Federal CIO will select, collaboratively with agency CIOs, the high-risk IT projects across the Federal Government. Using the IT Dashboard and other sources of information, agency CIOs shall describe the risk profile of the largest, most complex IT projects. Risk factors would include: - Significant cost or schedule variance from the current baseline
- Performance targets or mission objectives have not been met, 
- Frequent re-baselines, or 
- Lack of essential executive sponsorship/leadership.

The Federal CIO will schedule individual sessions with agency CIOs (as outlined in attachment A), between August 2 and August 18, to identify the highest risk projects across the Federal IT portfolio. The list of high-risk projects will be finalized by August 23. It is anticipated that 25 to 30 projects will be selected across the Federal government.

2. Develop Improvement Plans
Agencies shall submit a proposed improvement plan for each high-risk project. Agencies
shall submit proposed improvement plans to OMB no later than 30 days after their high-risk
projects are identified. While formal improvement plans are only required for these projects, agency CIOs are accountable for the performance of the entire IT portfolio, not limited to just the high-risk projects. Therefore, similar improvement plans should be applied to other high-risk projects in an agency’s entire IT portfolio. Agency proposed improvement plans should be based on thorough analysis of the projects’ issues and risks. Plans should be comprehensive, risk-adjusted, and reviewed through appropriate agency governance bodies. The plan may incorporate short and long term solutions that may extend through Budget Year 2012. If the agency CIO does not have high confidence in the probability of success of the investment, the agency CIO should recommend that the project be materially altered or terminated.
 
The proposed improvement plan should include:
a. Major challenges and causes of variance from the project baseline,
b. A summary of risks, mitigation strategies, and clear accountability,
c. Stronger contractor performance metrics and controls for existing contracts, and revised
acquisition strategies for contracts expected to be executed within the next fiscal year that
address the issues raised in the improvement plan,
d. A high-level schedule that articulates critical path items,
e. Agencies should describe how the project’s governance will be more rigorous because of
the improvement plan. Agencies should also describe how they will improve both
contract and program management oversight internally to ensure better performance, and
f. List the specific corrective actions to turn around the project.

3. Present Improvement Plans in TechStat Sessions
The proposed improvement plans for the selected high-risk projects will be reviewed in
OMB TechStat Accountability Sessions led by the Federal CIO. These sessions will be conducted between September and November. At the TechStat session, the agency will brief OMB on the improvement plans, revised schedules, and potential changes to budget requests.

The TechStat sessions will be used to inform OMB decisions on FY 2012 budget requests
and potential FY 2011 apportionments. TechStat sessions will also provide feedback and
recommendations to agencies concerning project scope, management and oversight. ",shall,Agencies,09/2010 (FY 2012 Budget Request Deadline),None specified,,,,,,,,X,,,,,,,,X,,X,x,x,x,,,

Data: For the purposes of this Memorandum, the term ""data"" refers to all structured information, unless otherwise noted. 
Dataset: For the purposes of this Memorandum, the  ""dataset"" refers to a collection of data presented in tabular or non-tabular form. 
Fair Information Practice Principles: The term ""Fair Information Practice Principles"" refers to the eight widely accepted principles for identifying and mitigating privacy impacts in information systems, programs and processes, delineated in the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace. 
Government information: As defined in OMB Circular A-130, ""government information"" means information created, collected, processed, disseminated, or disposed of, by or for the Federal Government. 
Information: As defined in OMB Circular A-130, the term "" information"" means any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts, data, or opinions in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual forms. 
Information life cycle: As defined in OMB Circular A-130, the term "" information life cycle"" means the stages through which information passes, typically characterized as creation or collection, processing, dissemination, use, storage, and disposition. 
Personally identifiable information: As defined in OMB Memorandum M-1 0-23 , 17 ""personally identifiable information"" (PIT) refers to information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual ' s identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. The definition of PII is not anchored to any single category of information or technology. Rather, it requires a case-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified. In performing this assessment, it is important for an agency to recognize that non-PIT can become PII whenever additional information is made publicly available (in any medium and from any source) that, when combined with other available information, could be used to identify an individual. 
Mosaic effect: The mosaic effect occurs when the information in an individual dataset, in isolation, may not pose a risk of identifying an individual (or threatening some other important interest such as security), but when combined with other available information, could pose such risk. Before disclosing potential PIT or other potentially sensitive information, agencies must consider other publicly available data - in any medium and from any source- to determine whether some combination of existing data and the data
intended to be' publicly released could allow for the identification of an individual or pose another security
concern. ",N/A,All Agencies ,None specified,None specified,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,X,,

In general, open data will be consistent with the following principles: 
• Public. Consistent with OMB's Open Government Directive, agencies must adopt a presumption in favor of openness to the extent permitted  by law and subject to privacy, confidentiality, security, or other valid restrictions. 
• Accessible. Open data are made available in convenient, modifiable, and open formats  that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched. Formats should be machine-readable (i.e., data are reasonably structured to allow automated processing). Open data structures do not discriminate against any person or group of persons and should be made available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes, often by providing the data in multiple formats for consumption. To the extent permitted by law, these formats should be non-proprietary, publicly available, and no restrictions should be placed upon their use. 
• Described. Open data are described fully so that consumers of the data have sufficient information to understand their strengths, weaknesses, analytical limitations, security requirements, as well as how to process them. This involves the use of robust, granular metadata (i.e., fields or elements that describe data), thorough documentation of data elements, data dictionaries, and, if applicable, additional descriptions of the purpose of the collection, the population of interest, the characteristics of the sample, and the method of data collection.
• Reusable. Open data are made available under an open license that places no restrictions on their use. 
• Complete. Open data are published in primary forms (i.e., as collected at the source), with the finest possible level of granularity that is practicable and permitted by law and other requirements. Derived or aggregate open data should also be published but must reference the primary data . 
• Timely. Open data are made available as quickly as necessary to preserve the value of the data. Frequency of release should account for key audiences and downstream needs. 
• Managed Post-Release. A point of contact must be designated to assist with data use and to respond to complaints about adherence to these open data requirements.",N/A,All Agencies ,None specified,None specified,,,,,,,,,x,x,,,x,,x,,,,,,,,,

88,Ensuring the Accessibility of Federal Electronic and Information Technologies Procured by Federal Agencies,https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/procurement/electronic_info_technologies.pdf,None,Memorandum,11/6/2007,None specified,None,"Office of Electronic Government and Information Technolocy, OMB, and Office of Federal Procurement Policy, OMB",None,None,"Section 508 of the Rehabi litation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (E&IT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that Federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs, which reduces barriers to job success and mobility. The law also helps to ensure that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. The purpose of this letter is to remind Chief Acquisition Officers (CAOs) and Chief Information Officers (CIOs) of their collaborative roles in this area and to suggest activities and tools to help agencies fulfill their responsibilities in implementing the law. 

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires agencies to acquire accessible E&IT unless an exception applies and is documented. Consideration of the Section 508 standards must be part of the procurement planning process, market research, and requirements definition, and the standards must be included in all applicable solicitations. The General Services Administration (GSA), as part of their statutory requirement to provide technical support for Section 508, assesses the extent to which agencies properly include applicable Section 508 standards using a sampling process of solicitations posted on FedBizOpps over the past few months. Across all agencies, a recent assessment by GSA showed that only 3% of the solicitations that included E&IT properly included the Section 508 standards. While some of the solicitations sampled included references to Section 508, a compliant document must, among other requirements, articulate the specific 508 standards that apply to that solicitation. 

These results demonstrate we are not adequately incorporating applicable Section 508 standards when acquiring E&IT. CAOs and CIOs should review their procurement and information technology acquisition policies and procedures to validate that the Section 508 standards are appropriately considered and clearly stated in solicitation documents. CAOs should consider sampling agency procurements that include E&IT to ensure they properly specify the appropriate Section 508 standards. Procurements that do not meet the standards should be amended. The attachment includes the assessment criteria that GSA uses, and CAOs should consider using these or similar criteria in their sampling effort. 

CIOs also have specific obligations to help ensure the applicable Section 508 standards are included in procurements for E&IT. Section 8(b)(xiii) of OMB Circular A- 130, “Management of Federal Information Resources,” requires agencies to ensure selected systems or processes facilitate accessibility under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and CIOs are responsible for monitoring agency implementation.  Additionally, Sections 53 and 300 of OMB Circular A-11, “Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget,” instruct agencies to ensure IT capital planning and control comply with Section 508 requirements.2 CIOs should instruct agency project managers to review capital planning and investment control documentation for compliance with Section 508. 

As part of its ongoing technical assistance and sampling activities, GSA’s Office of Information Technology Accessibility and Workforce may contact your Section 508 coordinator and the points of contact listed in solicitations that appear not to be compliant to offer additional assistance. 

A resource available to agencies is the Buy Accessible Wizard at www.buyaccessible.gov. This free tool guides requiring officials through the steps necessary to conduct acquisitions that comply with Section 508. CAOs and CIOs may incorporate the use of this tool into their procurement procedures to improve compliance with the law. Another resource is www.Section508.gov, which has information and free on-line training courses.",N/A,"Agency CIOs, Agency CAOs, Office of Information Technology Accessibility and Workforce, GSA",None specified,29 U.S.C. 794d (Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973),X,X,,,,,,,,,,,,,X,X,,X,,,,,,
